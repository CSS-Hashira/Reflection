                <h1>My Reflection</h1>
                <p>
                    A year that began quietly, stumbled into surprises, and ended up teaching me more than I expected.
                    2025 didn’t begin with grand success or a clear mindset, it began with unplanned visions, unexpected
                    surprises, and a few setbacks. <br>
                    The first few months were flavourless, almost like a sugar‑free coffee. But then came the phase
                    where my real self finally woke up and started to shine. Now comes August, my birthday month; When I
                    was gifted with the admission in a music school. Music school became the place where I learned
                    something new, a space where my soul enjoyed every note my fingers played, and a place that never
                    left me bored or exhausted. Then came my first gig — an amazing experience where I truly enjoyed
                    every tune I played as a guitarist. <br>
                    As the year moved forward, I kept preparing myself to face tougher and tougher challenges. My first
                    exams approached to test my knowledge; I still managed to shine there, even without studying [hehe].
                    <br>
                    Moving ahead, Comes 2 more continuous gigs where of course I exceled!!. I can never forget the
                    enjoyment I went through as a beginner - the cuts, the soreness, and the tears that taught me how to
                    endure it all, even while learning how to win. <br>

                    Now, Comes the most bestest part of this year- 21 December, The day on which My hard pays off and I
                    got the opportunity to show perform on a massive stage. I faced thousands of audience, enjoyed the
                    echo of their claps and sparked the event with the melodious tune of my guitar. With this jubilance,
                    Comes the end, Wrapping 2025 with the Aim to score above 85% in my upcoming Term-2 exams!! 🙂
